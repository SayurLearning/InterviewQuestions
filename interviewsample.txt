1.Write a program for Collatz_conjecture.
Collatz_conjecture means -  start with the input number. 
For even number , divide by 2 (n/2)
For odd number - 3n + 1
apply the above for the resulting number until the answer is 1.Eg, input is 8
output 8, 4,2, 1
input is 9
output 9,28,14,7,22,11,34,17,52,26,13,40,20,10,5,16,8,4,2,1

2. In the above program, get two numbers as input. Print the number that has less number of steps to reach 1.
3. No need to write a program. Just pseudocode is enough.Define a class for a instagram post. Define the properties and functions.
Define which one will be private and which one public.
4.
Encode the user input using the following alg, using the encode Key (a number)

For each word in the odd position, move each letter in the word by the number of positions mentioned in the key.
For words in the even position, reverse the word and then do the same as the odd position

Eg - Key 2, input sentence "I am the King"
Output K oc vjg ipkM
